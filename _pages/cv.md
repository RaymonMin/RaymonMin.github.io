Education
======
* BSc in Mathematics and Economics, double major in Computer Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), 2021-Present
  * CGA: 3.92/4.30 (~1% in school level); obtained A+ and A for all math courses; took all honor math courses provided in HKUST.
* Exchange Student, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
  * CGA: 3.93/4; obtained A* and A for all statistic courses.

Research project
=====
* Trade-off Between Privacy and Accuracy of Synthetic Data (Supervised by Prof. [Junhui WANG](https://sites.google.com/site/junhuiwang/Home?authuser=0), Chinese University of Hong Kong, 01/2024-Present)
  * Developed a privacy metric for generative models, extending the differential privacy examination framework to scenarios where traditional noise addition or model analysis techniques are ineffective.
  * Designing a penalty-based algorithm leveraging the novel privacy metric to balance privacy protection and downstream task accuracy of generated data in model training.
  * Developed a novel GAN algorithm under the proposed privacy metric, achieving improved downstream task accuracy while maintaining robust privacy protection.
* Differential Privacy for Inference in the Debiased LASSO Model (Supervised by Prof. [Xinzhou GUO](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/people/faculty/profile/xinzhoug/), Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, 09/2024-Present)
  * Providing proof of asymptotic normality theorem for a novel method combining differentially private de-biased lasso with bootstrap techniques to effectively address selection bias.
  * Providing proof of asymptotic normality theorem for an innovative method for multimodal EEG learning that integrates differential privacy principles.
* Knowledge Discovery over Database (Supervised by Prof. [Raymond Chi Wing WONG](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~raywong/), Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,02/2023-06/2023)
  * Conducted in-depth analysis and replication of published papers related to time-series. 
  * Identified and reported studies that notably enhanced prediction accuracy.  
  * Compiled and documented pertinent algorithms and data processing techniques for reference.

Service and leadership
======
* I am a student tutor at the [Math Support Center](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/~support/index.html) at HKUST, providing drop-in tutoring support for math courses.
* I am the founder and leader of  [“HKUST Notes Collection Center”](https://sites.google.com/view/hkustsharing), a student-run website dedicated to sharing self-written lecture notes across various subjects to enhance learning and exploration.
* I am also trying to summarize a note about basic knowledge of linear algebra based on my hand-writing note in the linear algebra course I took. Here is [the link of its draft](https://github.com/RaymonMin/Linear_algebra_note).
* I served as a student representative on the [Student Liaison Subcommittee](https://registry.hkust.edu.hk/resource-library/student-staff-liaison-committees) for two consecutive years, advocating for student interests and facilitating communication between students and faculty.
