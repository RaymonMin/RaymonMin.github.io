Education
======
* BSc in Mathematics and Economics, double major in Computer Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), 2021-Now
* Exchange student at UIUC

Research project
=====
* Trade-off Between Privacy and Accuracy of Synthetic Data (Supervised by Prof. Junhui WANG, Chinese University of Hong Kong, 01/2024-Now)
  * Developed a methodology for measuring the privacy protection of generative model trained by synthetic data.
  * Investigating statistical patterns between synthetic and real data.
  * Developing a loss function that optimizes model performance while simultaneously characterizing its privacy loss.
  * Summarizing the statistical optimization method and endeavored to author a paper on the subject.
* Policy Learning with Pessimism and Noise (Supervised by Prof. Xinzhou GUO, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, 04/2024-Now)
  * Researched the statistical and information-theoretic reasons for the enhancement of policy learning performance due to pessimism.
  * Attempting to replace complex, designed penalties with non-negative noise in optimization processes..
  * Establishing an appropriate confidence interval to depict the robustness of the learning effect.
* Knowledge Discovery over Database (Supervised by Prof. Raymond WONG, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,02/2023-06/2023)
  * Conducted in-depth analysis and replication of published papers related to time-series. 
  * Identified and reported studies that notably enhanced prediction accuracy.  
  * Compiled and documented pertinent algorithms and data processing techniques for reference.
  
Internship Experience
======
* Computer Department, Investment Research Center, Essence Securities Co., Ltd. (As a Assistant Analyst, Shanghai / Online, 06/2023-09/2023)
  * Conducted a statistical modelling analysis and created a research report on the company's market position, growth, and financial.

Service and leadership
======
* Currently leading to run a website aimed at sharing self-written lecture notes to help us learn and explore more, called [“HKUST Notes Collection Center”](https://sites.google.com/view/hkustsharing).
* I am also trying to summarize a note about basic knowledge of linear algebra based on my hand-writing note in the linear algebra course I took. Here is [the link of its draft](https://github.com/RaymonMin/Linear_algebra_note).
