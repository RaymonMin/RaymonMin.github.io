Hi! Welcome to my personal website! I am Ruiming (/ʐweɪ mɪŋ/, or you can simply call me Raymon) Min. I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in [Mathematics and Economics](https://maec.hkust.edu.hk/home) and [Computer Science](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/bsc/) at [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/).

My research interests include causal relations, explainable machine intelligence, synthetic data using generation models, and policy learning. 

I am currently collaborating with Professor [Junhui WANG](https://sites.google.com/site/junhuiwang/Home?authuser=0) on differential privacy in synthetic data generation models and causal relations. 
Additionally, I am working on my independent capstone project (final year project) under the supervision of Professor [Xinzhou GUO](https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/people/faculty/profile/xinzhoug/) in the field of differential privacy in high-dimensional linear models and policy learning.
